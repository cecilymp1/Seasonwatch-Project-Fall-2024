# Project Overview

The SeasonWatch project investigates phenological changes in tree species across India, to understand
potential climate-driven impacts. The goal is to identify shifts in timing and growth patterns for key
phenological stages, such as flowering and fruiting, and to track changes in response to seasonal and
climate variables.

## Abstract

To assess the potential impacts of climate change on tree phenological stages, the SeasonWatch
project investigates flowering, fruiting, and other seasonal stages in tree species across India, focusing on
Kerala. Phenological events are essential indicators of ecosystem health and biodiversity, and their shifts
can profoundly impact ecological interactions, including pollination, fruiting cycles, and species
distribution. This study combines citizen-submitted observations with historical datasets to assess
temporal changes over the past decade, providing insights into how tropical tree species respond to
changing environmental conditions.
The analysis reveals advanced statistical and computational methodologies, including regression
analysis to quantify relationships between phenological shifts and climate variables. Survival analysis is
used to model the timing and speed of transitions between phenological stages, offering insights into the
responsiveness of species to seasonal cues. Markov models estimate the probabilities of transitions
between discrete phenological states, while clustering techniques group species based on shared
